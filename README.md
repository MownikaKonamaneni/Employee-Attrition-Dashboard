## 📌 Project Overview

Employee attrition is a critical concern for organizations, often resulting in loss of talent, reduced productivity, and increased operational costs. This project dives deep into the **IBM Employee Attrition dataset** to identify key factors influencing attrition, uncover trends, and suggest actionable strategies to enhance retention.

Through comprehensive **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** using **Tableau**, we visualize complex relationships among demographic, job-related, and satisfaction variables. The goal is to empower HR and organizational stakeholders with data-driven insights to address and mitigate employee turnover.

## 🎯 Objectives

* Analyze employee attrition patterns and trends
* Identify key drivers of employee turnover
* Develop actionable insights for improving employee retention
* Present findings using interactive Tableau dashboards

## 📚 Literature Review Summary

This project draws inspiration from a range of academic and practical studies:

* **HR practices:** Training, compensation, and performance appraisal significantly influence retention.
* **CSR and Retention:** CSR initiatives aligned with employee needs enhance job satisfaction.
* **Predictive Modeling:** Factors like age, income, and job satisfaction are strong predictors of attrition.
* **Machine Learning Insights:** Monthly income, overtime, and commute distance affect turnover intentions.
